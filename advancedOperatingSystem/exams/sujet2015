= What I remember from the OS subject =

== Olivier's part ==

1) Describe the memory layout for a Type I hypervisor to host a guest OS
    - Describe it in terms of regions, pages, page access rights
    - What are the limitations, if any ?

2) Why does the DMA use physical addresses and not virtual addresses ?
    - Remark we do not consider IOMMU, just regular MMU and DMA

3) Assume the following mapping :
    * MMU
        - 2000 -> void
        - 2100 -> void
    * shadow page table (virtual to real)
        - 2000 -> 1500
        - 2100 -> void
    * real to physical  : 1500 -> void
    * Questions
        - Describe what happens when the process reads the page 2000
            - Describe it in regards to the hardware, the type I hypervisor
              and the guest OS
        - Same for page 2100

4) Let's assume the system does not have a page table, only a TLB
    - Design a way to exploit the TLB for a Type-I hypervisor
    - Evaluate the performance of your design

5) Evaluate the overhead when we use an external pager for a microkernel.
   We suppose the microkernel has blocking IPC. Evaluate it in terms of :
    - latency
    - System calls
    - Code path
    - Locality in i-cache and d-cache
    - interrupts

6) Design a file server for a microkernel with non-blocking IPC. We suppose
  standard libC function calls.

7) If you have a Type-I hypervisor with different ISAs, how useful are hardware
  extensions ? You will base your argumentation on a hypervisor running on bare
  metal, emulating a x86 ISA from an ARM processor.

== Renault's part =======================================================================================

8) Don't take this one for granted. The questions might change. I believe
  Renault change his questions a lot more often than Olivier, but this might
  just be speculation ;)

  I remembered a lot less questions about this part. They were about specific
  aspect of the course. Before the exam, write on your sheet all the names you
  can find. Or you might find yourself in frustration, not knowing what is the
  exam talking about.

9) Question about the SR-IOV
    - What device is this ?
        - No further explanation is given in the question. You'd better remember
          what actually is an SR-IOV. Just print out all the acronyms in the
          course, just to be sure.
    - How useful is it when coupled with an IOMMU ?

10) Cite an advantage and a disadvantage of a modular type-I hypervisor (can't
  remember the example) compared to a monolithic type-I hypervisor (like Linux
  KVM).

11) A friend of yours claim "With the new x86 hardware support for virtualization,
  we don't need para-virtualization anymore !"
    - Do you agree with him ? If so, explain why.
    - If you disagree, explain why with at least 1 counter-example

12) Compare the security between :
    - A Linux process running in Dune mode (no hypervisor)
    - A process running within a Type-II Virtual Machine, with an "OS-library"
      linked to the application
    - *note*: I believe this question was referring to two of the presentations
      we had to do. In doubt, just take notes of the presentations so that you
      actually _remember_ what it was about in the exam.

== That's all folks ==
* Good luck with your OS exam ! May Olivier be with you. Just avoid cookies.
