	- Definitions
		* Bit-distance product:		?
		* Range of transmission		? Is it the distance between nodes, or the distance at which nodes may communicate
		* Capacity:			~ througput (in this context)
		* Power:			Energy per second


	- Transmission success (over 1 hop): function of the distance sender/receiver, the distance between other transmissions nodes on the same chanel
	
	- Protocol model: Transmission success only depends on the distance between the sender and all the other senders
